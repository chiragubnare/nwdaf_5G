# nwdaf_5G
This model is designed corrsponding to the attached research paper titled "Intelligent_network_data_analytics_function_in_5G_cellular_networks_using_machine_learning".
It predicts the abnormal behavior of NWDAF on a Network group of User Equipments(UE) in a 5G Network, as well as it computes the Network load performance of the particular 5G network.
It works on a synthetic generated Dataset with some added anaomalies to look dataset more genuine.
I am still working on Anomalies detection using Extreme Gradient Boosting, the notebook will be uploaded soon.
