# nwdaf_5G
It predicts the abnormal behavior of NWDAF on a group of User Equipments(UE), as well as it computes the Network load performance of the particular network.
It works on a synthetic generated Dataset with some added anaomalies to look dataset more genuine.
I am still working on Anomalies detection using Extreme Gradient Boosting, the notebook will be uploaded soon.
